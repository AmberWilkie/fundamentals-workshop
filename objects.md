## Objects and Attributes

### Everything* is an object
\*almost everything

What we've been doing is called "object oriented programming" because we are working with languages that use objects. Consider this example:

```ruby
my_array = []
```

We've created a variable, which is an object, called "my_array" and we've set it equal to an empty array. By doing so, we've given `my_array` a whole set of properties that are built into Ruby. Every array in Ruby has certain properties and now ours does too. For instance:

```ruby
my_array.length
=> 0
```

Here we're calling a *method* that is defined as part of the `Array` class in Ruby. We didn't write it but we now have access to it. `Array#length` tells you how many items are in your array.
>There are a bunch of things like this in programming - you'll just have to google for what's available. (Or ask your teachers)

**Back to Objects**

What's an object?
* Variables
* Arrays
* Hashes
* Instances of Classes

Consider:

```ruby
class Person
    attr_accessor :name, :age, :location
end

amber = Person.new
amber.name = "Amber"
amber.age = 32
amber.location = "Gothenburg"
```

`amber` is an object. And that object is an *instance* of `Person`. The object `amber` has properties / attributes of `name`, `age` and `location`. The values of those attributes are `Amber`, `32` and `Gothenburg`.

When we create an object, we are making a new, blank version of everything in `Person`. We can define that object based on the rules we establish in `Person` (the methods and variables we have written into it). And that object can do everything a `Person` can do.
