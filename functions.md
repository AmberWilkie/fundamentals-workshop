## Functions / methods

>The words "function" and "method" are used interchangeably, depending on what you're reading. You should think of them as the same thing.

**A function is a bit of code that *does* something.**

This is a function in Ruby:

```ruby
def do_something
  return "something"
end
```

And here's one in Javascript:

```javascript
function do_something() {
  return "something"
};
```

#### Passing information into our methods

Our functions can also *accept* information and use it. Here we are going to pass in the value stored in the variable "number".

```ruby
number = 5
def show_number(whatup)
  return whatup * 2
end

show_number(number)
=> 10
```

> Remember that Ruby doesn't need us to type "return", it will automatically return from the last line of code in our function. However I've kept it here because there's nothing wrong with doing it and it makes everything more explicit.

#### Following inputs all the way down

Let's head back to the example above. What is the relationship between `whatup` and `number`? In this example, I've replaced the variables (nicknames) with the values they are holding.

```ruby
number = 5
show_number(5)
  # and when it goes into our function
  return 5*2
end

=> 10
```

**It's critically important to be able to follow your values all the way down into the functions you are calling.** Many times we are putting variables into functions into variables on and on. If we can keep track of what information those variables hold the whole way through, we will be able to write our code. Otherwise, we will be completely lost.

## Classes

Classes are collections of functions and variables that can be encapsulated in one object.

An example (in Ruby):

```ruby
class Person
  attr_accessor :name

  def go_to_bootcamp
    return "Bootcamp is great!"
  end
end
```

We've created a class `Person` that has one attribute, `name`, and who can do one thing: `#go_to_bootcamp`. So now we can create an *instance* of Person. We can create an infinite number of instances of Person and they can interact.

Ruby:
```ruby
amber = Person.new
amber.name = "Amber"

amber.go_to_bootcamp
=> "Bootcamp is great!"

amber.name
=> "Amber"
```

**Javascript doesn't have classes, exactly. Instead we use a concept called "inheritance" to "extend" other functions.** All you really need to understand, at this point, is that:

```javascript
function FizzBuzz() {};

FizzBuzz.prototype.count = function(num) {
  // some code will run here
}
```

means that a FizzBuzz object can do count. Any function we create using `FizzBuzz.prototype.functionName` can be done by a FizzBuzz object.

```javascript
player = new FizzBuzz();
player.count(3);
=> undefined
```

but note! it doesn't throw an error, we just didn't tell the function `count` to do anything. There's nothing to return, so it's undefined.
