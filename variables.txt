### Variables, Continued

**There are different kinds of variables. They are defined sometimes by how long they live.**

**Instance variables** are available to an entire *instance*, across different functions.

**Local variables** are only available within their own block (typically a function). They are destroyed when the computer is done running the code.

**Other times they are defined ALSO by the *type* of information stored in them. It depends on the language.**
